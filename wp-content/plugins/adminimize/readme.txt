Adminimize that lets you hide 'unnecessary' items from the WordPress backend

== Description ==
If you manage a multi-author WordPress blog or WordPress sites for clients, then you may have wondered if it was possible to clean up the WordPress admin area for your users? There are lots of things in the WordPress admin area that your users don’t need to see or use. This plugin help you to hide unnecessary items from WordPress admin area.

Adminimize makes it easy to remove items from view based on a user’s role.

= What does this plugin do? =
The plugin changes the administration backend and gives you the power to assign rights on certain parts. Admins can activate/deactivate every part of the menu and even parts of the sub-menu. Meta fields can be administered separately for posts and pages. Certain parts of the write menu can be deactivated separately for admins or non-admins. The header of the backend is minimized and optimized to give you more space and the structure of the menu gets changed to make it more logical - this can all be done per user so each role and their resulting users can have his own settings.

= Support Custom Post Type =
The plugin support all functions also for custom post types, automatically in the settings page.

= Support Custom Options on all different post types =
It is possible to add own options to hide areas in the back-end of WordPress. It is easy and you must only forgive a ID or class, a selector, of the markup, that you will hide.

= Compatibility with plugins for MetaBoxes in Write-area =
You can add your own options, you must only check for css selectors.
